# Configuration file for TravisCI

# We use miniconda for Python so don't need any Python specific tools
language: generic

# Use the container builds so we don't need sudo priviledges
sudo: false

# Don't send out emails every time a build fails
notifications:
    email: false

# Only build pushes to the master branch and tags. This avoids the double
# builds than happen when working on a branch instead of a fork.
branches:
    only:
        - master
        # Regex to build tagged commits with version numbers
        - /\d+\.\d+(\.\d+)?(\S*)?$/

# Define environment variables common to all builds
env:
    global:
        # These files list the requirements to be installed by conda
        - CONDA_REQUIREMENTS=requirements.txt
        - CONDA_REQUIREMENTS_DEV=requirements-dev.txt

# Setup the build environment
before_install:
    # Get the Fatiando CI scripts to install miniconda
    - git clone --branch=1.1.1 --depth=1 https://github.com/fatiando/continuous-integration.git
    # Download and install miniconda and setup dependencies
    # Need to source the script to set the PATH variable globaly
    - source continuous-integration/travis/setup-miniconda.sh
    # Show installed pkg information for postmortem diagnostic
    - conda list

# Install the package that we want to test
install:
    # Make a binary wheel for our package and install it
    - python setup.py bdist_wheel
    - pip install dist/*

# Run the actual tests and checks
script:
    # Check format with black
